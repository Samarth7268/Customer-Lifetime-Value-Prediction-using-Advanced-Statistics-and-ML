# Customer-Lifetime-Value-Prediction-using-Advanced-Statistics-and-ML
In this project, we built a robust end-to-end pipeline to predict Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for an e-commerce platform, leveraging advanced statistical methods and machine learning to drive informed marketing and retention strategies. The pipeline combines survival analysis techniques—such as the Kaplan-Meier estimator and Cox proportional hazards regression—to model user churn behavior and estimate the probability of customer retention over time. Alongside these, we incorporated regression-based approaches and machine learning models to quantify monetary value, frequency, and recency, enabling precise CLV forecasts.

We further enhanced the reliability of predictions through statistical hypothesis testing and validation procedures that grounded our insights in rigorous analysis. The project also involved detailed segmentation of customer cohorts based on behavioral attributes, which was visualized through interactive plots and dashboards to empower business intelligence teams. These insights are tailored for strategic decision-making in marketing, personalization, and customer engagement, ultimately boosting ROI.
